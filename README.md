# Unity3D Multiplayer VR Template

A barebones Multiplayer VR Template for Unity3D. (Includes SteamVR v1.08)

Seperate scenes for Local Network or Internet version.

## Local network version
Both PCs need to be on same subnet to find each other.

Make sure "Run as server" on LocalNetworkManager is only checked on one of the PCs.

## Internet version
Replace the project id with one of your own and enable multiplayer.

Set "Create Room" on InternetManager on one of the PCs and start that one first.
